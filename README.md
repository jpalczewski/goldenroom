# Golden Room

A vibe coding experiment exploring psychedelic/oneiric 3D reconstruction in Godot 4.5.

## About

This project is an experiment in collaborative development between a human and [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), translating abstract oneiric and psychedelic visions into an interactive 3D experience. The focus is on atmosphere, subtle movement, and a dreamlike aesthetic rather than traditional gameplay.

> **Native Only:** Wholeheartedly, I'd love for this to be friendly-to-click in your browser, but I fell in love with forward+ rendering capabilities. This experience is **exclusively native**—no web support planned. ❤️

## Tech Stack

- **Engine**: Godot 4.5
- **Language**: GDScript
- **Graphics**: Custom spatial shaders with MultiMesh instancing
- **AI**: Claude Opus + Claude Haiku with MCP Context7 (live Godot docs for vibe optimization)
- **Platform**: Native (Desktop)

## Running

```bash
# Open in Godot 4.5 editor
godot --path .

# Or run directly
godot --path . res://menu.tscn
```
